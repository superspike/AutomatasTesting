In order to use the tool download the zip file MutationTool. It contains an 
executable file and a folder with almost all the mealy machines benchmarks from 
https://automata.cs.ru.nl/Overview#Mealymachinebenchmarks. 
After the zip is downloaded open a command prompt on the location where this 
file is and type this:

java -cp MutationTool.jar view.MainWindow
